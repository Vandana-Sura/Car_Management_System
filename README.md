The *Spring Boot Car Management App* is a comprehensive backend application designed to manage car-related data and operations efficiently. This application leverages Spring Boot's robust features, such as dependency injection, data persistence, and RESTful APIs, to provide a seamless experience for managing cars in a database. The app is built with a layered architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.

The application supports various operations, including adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting car records. It integrates with a MySQL database for storing and managing car details like name, model, year, color, and fuel type. To ensure modularity and reusability, the project employs Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for encapsulating data, while the service layer handles business logic and interacts with the repository layer. The repository layer uses Spring Data JPA to perform CRUD operations and custom queries on the database, ensuring optimized data access.

ModelMapper is used for mapping entities and DTOs, simplifying the transformation of data between different layers of the application. The RESTful API endpoints are implemented using Spring's annotation-driven programming model, providing a user-friendly interface for external applications or clients to interact with the system. The app also includes OpenAPI integration for generating API documentation, making it easier for developers to explore and utilize the available endpoints.

With a focus on scalability and ease of use, the app is equipped with features like global Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support to enable seamless integration with front-end applications. The project is configured to support MySQL as the database and is designed to run on Java 17, ensuring compatibility with modern Java standards. The application's architecture and features make it an ideal solution for efficiently managing car data in a structured and reliable manner.
